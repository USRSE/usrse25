# General Volunteering Opportunities

If you are interested in volunteering during the conference, please indicate your interest by [submitting this form](https://forms.gle/gaABue72wFwoXgFE8). As specific volunteering roles are clarified closer to the conference, the conference organizers may reach out to you about those opportunities.

# USRSE'25 Mentorship Program

The Mentorship Program pairs students and early-career attendees with experienced mentors. 
There is only one required event for the Mentorship Program, a "Mentorâ€“Mentee Lunch" on 
Monday, October 6, but pairs are encouraged to stay in touch following the conference. 
For more information and to participate (either as a mentor or mentee), please
[fill out the matching questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpChAMh7E23ti9oXGCZsGTSCgutqXT_JO-dcd6UmDcc_5zew/viewform) 
by September 21.

[Apply here by August 8](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/SHInstitute/).

* Review Committee members: US-RSE and other computational science and engineering community members with an interest in supporting students from a variety of backgrounds and with an interest in the mission of the [Building Engagement](https://shinstitute.org/the-building-engagement-be-program/) program; committee members will review applications for funded participants in late August; all work will be completed virtually in 1-2 hours. [Apply here by August 15](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/SHInstitute/).
