# General volunteering opportunities

If you are interested in volunteering during the conference, please indicate your interest by [submitting this form](https://forms.gle/gaABue72wFwoXgFE8). As specific volunteering roles are clarified closer to the conference, the conference organizers may reach out to you about those opportunities.

# BE program volunteers

Under the [Building Engagement (BE) program](https://shinstitute.org/building-engagement-us-rse-2025/) from Sustainable Horizons Institute, we are currently recruiting volunteers for these roles:

* Guided Affinity Group Leaders: work with a small group of students to help them get the most out of the conference; must already have funding to attend the conference; for more information visit the [BE@US-RSE Guided Affinity Groups](https://shinstitute.org/guided-affinity-groups-us-rse25/) page. [Apply here by August 8](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/SHInstitute/).

* Review Committee members: US-RSE and other computational science and engineering community members with an interest in supporting students from a variety of backgrounds and with an interest in the mission of the [Building Engagement](https://shinstitute.org/the-building-engagement-be-program/) program; committee members will review applications for funded participants in late August; all work will be completed virtually in 1-2 hours. [Apply here by August 15](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/SHInstitute/).

Unfortunately, funding for volunteers is not available. If you have any questions please contact: BE@shinstitute.org
