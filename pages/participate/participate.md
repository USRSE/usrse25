# Volunteers

We are currently seeking volunteers for various [conference planning committees](/usrse25/about/organization).  There will be additional opportunities to volunteer as a reviewer and to help during the conference.

# Call for Participation

Submissions will open in late winter 2025. 

Following on the conference theme, USRSE'25 is looking for submissions in three main areas:

* Code: share your research software
* Practices: discuss research software engineering practices
* People: all things related to research software engineers
