## Submission Details
*Session times noted in the descriptions are subject to 
change pending finalization of the conference program.*  

## Birds of a Feather (BoFs)

Birds of a Feather sessions are an opportunity to discuss a topic 
of shared interest to the RSE community.  Successful submissions 
should appeal to a quarter to a half of conference attendees. 
BoFs may be organized as a structured discussion with participants,
a panel, or a question and answer session. BoF abstracts/descriptions 
are not included in the conference proceedings. BoF sessions are
75-90 minutes. *Make sure to attach the PDF to your submission.*
[BoF submission template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Yto8Vbgv90avxSStFHyZ4ImvCGizWmJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110633704377428446960&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

## Workshops
This year, workshops (aka Tutorials) will take place in person at the conference.
Workshops should teach the participants a new skill and include exercises or 
other active learning components.  Both technical and professional skills 
workshops are welcome.  Workshop abstracts/descriptions are not included in the 
conference proceedings.  Workshop sessions are 90 minutes. *Make sure to attach the PDF to your submission.*

## Papers
Paper submissions must be original work not published elsewhere.  Papers 
may be up to 10 pages in length, including figures, not counting 
references. Submissions should adhere to the 
[IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) in US letter 
size as a PDF file. Papers will be published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/usrse25). Paper authors will have an opportunity to submit their paper to 
a [special journal issue](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/special-issue/) for publication 
after the conference. Accepted papers will have approximately 15 minutes to present their work 
during the conference. *Make sure to attach the PDF to your submission.*

## Talks
Talks on all topics of interest to the conference are encouraged.  Talk 
proposals sharing work published elsewhere are permitted. Talk abstracts 
and presentation slides will be included in the conference proceedings 
on Zenodo.  Accepted talks will have approximately 15 minutes to present 
their work during the conference. *Make sure to attach the PDF to your submission.*

## Notebooks

Notebook submissions should demonstrate a computational workflow or analysis, using Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown, or other commonly used formats. Submissions must be accessible via a public Git repository (e.g., GitHub) or a public platform (e.g., Google Colab), and must include a README that explains the purpose of the notebook and provides clear instructions for running it and reproducing the results. Be sure to include the URL in your EasyChair entry.

After submission, track chairs may request additional materials or refinements to ensure reproducibility prior to review. Accepted notebooks will be included in the conference proceedings on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/usrse25). Notebook authors will have approximately 15 minutes to present their work during the conference. 

For reference, see [last year's accepted notebooks](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/program/notebooks/).

## Posters
Posters are a chance to discuss your work with the community during 
an evening reception.  Both typical academic posters and less 
traditional poster formats are encouraged.  Papers, talks, and 
notebooks that are not accepted may be resubmitted as posters using 
the poster submission template. Poster size constraints will be 
announced to accepted posters. Posters will be included in the conference proceedings on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/usrse25).
*Make sure to attach the PDF to your submission.*
