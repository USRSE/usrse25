## Hotel

[Philadelphia Marriott Old City](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/phlmo-philadelphia-marriott-old-city/overview/) <br>
One Dock St, Philadelphia, PA 19106

The conference hotel is also the conference venue!

### Room Reservations

We would greatly appreciate you staying at the conference hotel.  Maintaining reasonable conference registration rates requires that we fill the hotel room reservation block.

Please plan to arrive on Sunday, October 5, 2025.  The conference starts early Monday morning, and we are planning an informal networking event on Sunday evening.

A room block at the hotel is available only for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. A reservation for those three nights can be made online through the links below. If you need to add Wednesday night (Oct 8), please first make your online reservation and then email Andrea Rubinstein (alrubins@princeton.edu) to get Wednesday night added. Include your Marriott reservation confirmation number in your message to Andrea.

* [Regular reservation link](https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1737661853085&key=GRP&guestreslink2=true&app=resvlink ) - $239/night + taxes
* [Government rate reservation link](https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1737661921114&key=GRP&guestreslink2=true&app=resvlink ) (for valid government employee travel) - $218/night + taxes

If the room block is full, please contact us at [usrse25-conference@us-rse.org](mailto:usrse25-conference@us-rse.org) so we can investigate adding additional rooms.

**Room reservations must be made by September 12, 2025.**

If you plan to arrive Saturday, we encourage you to make your room reservation early; the hotel has indicated that they usually sell out on Saturday nights. We unfortunately needed to limit the room block to Sunday through Tuesday nights because we have to pay for rooms that are not filled.

Additional evening reception events with some food and drinks will also be held and included in the registration fee.
