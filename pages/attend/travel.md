## Hotel

[Philadelphia Marriott Old City](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/phlmo-philadelphia-marriott-old-city/overview/) <br>
One Dock St, Philadelphia, PA 19106

The conference hotel is also the conference venue!

### Room Reservations

We would greatly appreciate you staying at the conference hotel.  Maintaining reasonable conference registration rates requires that we fill the hotel room reservation block.

Please plan to arrive on Sunday, October 5, 2025.  The conference starts early Monday morning, and we are planning an informal networking event on Sunday evening.

A room block at the hotel is available only for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights (Oct 5-7). A reservation for those three nights can be made online through the links below. If you need to add Saturday night (Oct 4) and/or Wednesday night (Oct 8), please first make your online reservation and then email Andrea Rubinstein (alrubins@princeton.edu) with your request. Include your Marriott reservation confirmation number in your message to Andrea.

* [Regular reservation link](https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1737661853085&key=GRP&guestreslink2=true&app=resvlink ) - $239/night + taxes
* The government rate room block is FULL

If the regular room block is full, please contact us at [usrse25-conference@us-rse.org](mailto:usrse25-conference@us-rse.org) so we can investigate adding additional rooms.

**Room reservations must be made by September 12, 2025.**

If you plan to arrive Saturday (Oct 4), we encourage you to make your room reservation early; the hotel has indicated that they usually sell out on Saturday nights. We unfortunately needed to limit the room block to Sunday through Tuesday nights because we have to pay for rooms that are not filled.


## Food

The conference registration fee includes breakfast and lunch on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  

Additional evening reception events with some food and drinks will also be held and included in the registration fee. 


## Getting to Philadelphia

* The Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is about 10 miles (15-35 minutes by car, depending on traffic) from the conference hotel. 
* The Philadelphia Amtrak train station is 2.5 miles from the conference hotel. 
* Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is about 80 miles (75-100 minutes by car, depending on traffic) from Philadelphia.
* The hotel does NOT have an airport shuttle.
* The daily parking rate at the hotel is $60.  There are additional parking garages approximately a half-mile from the hotel.  

### Transportation from PHL to the conference area (Old City)
You have two main options to reach Old City from PHL:

* **By Train:**
SEPTA’s Airport Line runs approximately every 30 minutes and connects the airport to **30th Street Station**, **Suburban Station**, and **Jefferson Station** in Center City. From there, you can transfer to the **Market-Frankford Line (MFL)** subway (also called the “El”) and take it eastbound toward **2nd Street Station**, which is within walking distance of Old City.

* **By Taxi/Rideshare:**
A taxi from the airport to Old City typically takes 15–35 minutes, depending on traffic, and has a flat rate of around $30–35 plus tip. This is the most convenient option, especially if you're carrying luggage or arriving during off-peak hours. If you're being reimbursed by your company, this is usually the simplest and most efficient choice.
