US-RSE is providing travel support for a limited number of USRSE'25 conference attendees.  This funding is thanks to a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support US-RSE's development.  

To apply for travel support, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/2BHm7zX78AcWmVmP7) by August 29, 2025.  Applicants will be notified of funding decisions by September 3, 2025.  

The need for travel support this year is high due to changes in the national research funding landscape, and funding is limited.  We ask that you only apply for funding if you have exhausted all options from your institution or employer for support.  The application form asks about your efforts to obtain alternative funding to attend the conference.  We are unlikely to be able to provide support for everyone who applies.

Eligibility and review criteria:

* Potential attendees over 18 years of age who reside in the US.  
* Able to attend all 3 days of the conference.
* Any career stage.  Note however that while students may apply and will be considered for funding, funding will be prioritized for non-student attendees, as the [Sustainable Horizons Institute Building Engagement Program](https://shinstitute.org/building-engagement-us-rse-2025/) provides one option for student attendees.  
* Priority will be given to those who are active in the US research software community and those who have not previously received travel support for a previous US-RSE conference.  

Three types of support will be available.  We may not be able to provide all three types of support to every applicant.

* Conference registration fee
* 3 nights of conference hotel
* Reimbursement for airfare or train tickets for travel

Additional costs and expenses will not be covered and will be the responsibility of the attendee.
