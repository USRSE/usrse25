A photographer will be present at USRSE'25 taking photographs.  Photographs may be used by US-RSE and US-RSE members for non-commercial purposes including but not limited to promoting the association and association activities, documenting events, sharing on social media, or in presentations or reports about US-RSE and its activities.

By attending the event, you grant permission for members of the US-RSE Association to use your image and likeness for non-commercial use without payment or any other consideration.  Your image may be edited, copied, exhibited, published, or distributed.  You waive the right to inspect or approve any products where your likeness appears and to royalties or other compensation arising or related to the use of your image.

If you do not want your photograph taken, a special "no photos" lanyard will be available during the on-site event registration.  The photographer will do their best to avoid including those wearing the indicated lanyard in photographs; US-RSE will review photographs before sharing or using them and make a good faith effort to exclude those that include the face of a person clearly wearing a "no photos" lanyard and fewer than 12 people.  Those wearing "no photos" lanyards may still appear in the background of photos or photos of rooms or groups.  Posing for a photograph, even if wearing the "no photos" lanyard, indicates your consent for the photo to be used by US-RSE.

While efforts will be made to honor the "no photos" lanyard, you may still appear in photographs that are used by US-RSE.  If you have concerns about the use of photos after the conference, contact <contact@us-rse.org> to discuss.

Any personal headshots (optional conference activity) will be given to the subject to use in any way they desire and not published or distributed by US-RSE.

If you have concerns about photography at the conference, please contact <usrse25-conference@us-rse.org> ahead of the conference to discuss.

By attending USRSE'25, you consent to this photography policy.
