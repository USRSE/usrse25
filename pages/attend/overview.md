## Accessibility

If there is an accommodation that will support your conference attendance, please let us know as soon as possible: [usrse25-conference@us-rse.org](mailto:usrse25-conference@us-rse.org)

We are still finalizing event details and will provide more information as it is available.  

* An all-gender restroom will be available.
* A small quiet room (sits about 10 people at a conference table) will be available during conference programming.  This is for people who need a sensory break and opportunity to reset alone in a quiet environment.  Those using this room are expected to be silent and to not engage others in the space.  If you need another private space during the conference, please check at the registration desk about other options.  
* If you need a nursing or medical room during the event and will not have your own hotel room at the Marriott, please let us know at [usrse25-conference@us-rse.org](mailto:usrse25-conference@us-rse.org) and we will ensure that one is available.
* The [hotel website](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/phlmo-philadelphia-marriott-old-city/overview/) includes floorplan information and 3D walk-throughs of the common spaces if you'd like to familiarize yourself with venue before attending.
* If you need a letter to support a travel visa application, please contact [usrse25-conference@us-rse.org](mailto:usrse25-conference@us-rse.org).
* We take the [Code of Conduct](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/about/code-of-conduct/) seriously.
* All speakers (including those asking questions) are asked to use a microphone so that everyone can hear.
* The walk to the Moshulu on Thursday evening is about half a mile and goes over a highway and along the river.  If this walk is inaccessible for you, please let the registration desk know by 3pm on Tuesday.
* See information on food during the conference [below](#food).
* There will be a DJ at the Moshulu; there are multiple decks on the ship if you are looking for a quieter area, but if you are noise sensitive, consider bringing ear plugs.  

If there is something that you're concerned about, please contact us at [usrse25-conference@us-rse.org](mailto:usrse25-conference@us-rse.org).  We want all members of the US-RSE community to be comfortable attending the event.

## Food

Food restrictions shared on the conference registration form have been shared with the staff at the Marriott and the Moshulu.  We have chosen menu options with dietary restrictions in mind.  If you have particular concerns, or have food restrictions that require an individual meal (such as Celiac disease), please contact [Christian Tabedzki](mailto:ct5868@princeton.edu).  If you encounter an issue with food options during the conference, the staff at the Marriott should be able to answer questions about the food served; please come to the registration desk if you need assistance.
