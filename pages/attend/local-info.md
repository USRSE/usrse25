## Transportation
**Philadelphia International Airport (PHL)**

Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is the closest major airport, located about 10 miles from Center City. You have two main options to reach the conference area (Old City):

* **By Train:**
SEPTA’s Airport Line runs approximately every 30 minutes and connects the airport to **30th Street Station**, **Suburban Station**, and **Jefferson Station** in Center City. From there, you can transfer to the **Market-Frankford Line (MFL)** subway (also called the “El”) and take it eastbound toward **2nd Street Station**, which is within walking distance of Old City.


* **By Taxi/Rideshare:**
A taxi from the airport to Old City typically takes about 20–30 minutes depending on traffic and has a flat rate of around $30–35 plus tip. This is the most convenient option, especially if you're carrying luggage or arriving during off-peak hours. If you're being reimbursed by your company, this is usually the simplest and most efficient choice.
