# Student & Early-Career Focused Sessions

<a name="student-panel-Monday"></a>
## RSEs Across Domains

Monday, October 6, 10:30am to 12:00pm

This panel session will delve into the nuances in Research Software Engineers’ experiences 
across industry, academia, and laboratories, focusing on how each environment shapes 
funding, benefits, daily work, and career trajectories. Panelists will give brief 
introductions and then respond to guided questions, followed by an open Q&A. Designed with 
students and early-career RSEs in mind, the session is open to all.

## From First Commit to First Offer: What I Wish I'd Known

Tuesday, October 7, 3:15 - 4:30pm
 
Join us for a set of talks where Research Software Engineers share the insights they wish 
they’d had on day one. We’ll cover how to navigate a shifting career landscape, what hiring 
managers look for, how to survive impostor syndrome, and how to keep code alive long after 
publication. Each speaker will share years of hindsight into practical advice. Designed 
with students and early-career RSEs in mind, the session is open to all.
