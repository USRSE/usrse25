USRSE'25 is the third installment of the annual US Research Software Engineering Conference.  It is hosted by the US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE).  We expect 300+ attendees in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in October 2025.  While we hope attendees will [join](https://us-rse.org/join) US-RSE, membership is not required to attend.
