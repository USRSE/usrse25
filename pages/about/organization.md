### Planning Committee

We are currently looking for volunteers for the USRSE'25 Planning Committee.

If the conference planning committee isn't for you, don't worry!  There will be additional opportunities to volunteer as a reviewer, for support tasks during the conference, and for organizing virtual events.  

#### Areas

**Technical Program:** 

**Communications:**

**Logistics:**

**Sponsors:**

**Student Program:**

**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion:** Unlike with the other areas, DEI is not a standalone committee or activity.  We are looking for a chair and vice chair who will help advise across the different areas and committees.  In addition, the DEI chair and vice chair will coordinate Code of Conduct reporting during the conference.  

#### Roles

**Committee Chairs:** Committee chairs should have experience related to the area they are 

**Committee Vice Chairs:** Committee vice chair positions are a good opportunity for those looking to gain experience with conference planning.  Vice chairs should work closely with the chairs, be able to step in to lead their committee or participate in general conference committee meetings when the chair is not available, and hopefully serve in a committee chair role in the future.  

**Committee Members:**



#### Expectations for Volunteers

Participating in the conference planning committee is a year-long commitment.  Meetings will begin in December 2024 and continue through the conference in October 2025.

Volunteers should be members of US-RSE.  It's free to [join](https://us-rse.org/join).

Committee chairs and vice chairs are expected to register for and attend the conference in Philadelphia in October 2025.  All committee members are highly encouraged to attend as well.  Volunteers are welcome to apply for any available travel support for the conference, but financial support for attendance is not guaranteed.

**Meetings:** 
* General Conference Committee Meetings will be held on Friday afternoons at 3pm Eastern time.  Committee chairs are expected to attend the general meetings.  Committee vice chairs are strongly encouraged to attend, and other committee members are welcome.  General conference committee meetings will initially be held monthly, then biweekly, then weekly in the last few months before the conference.
* Topical committee meetings will be scheduled as needed by the committee chairs.



#### How to Volunteer

Please let us know what roles you're interested in by filling out this form by November 30, 2024.
