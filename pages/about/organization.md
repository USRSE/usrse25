We are currently looking for volunteers for the USRSE'25 Planning Committee.  Details on available roles are below.

If the conference planning committee isn't for you, don't worry!  There will be additional opportunities to volunteer as a reviewer, for support tasks during the conference, and for organizing virtual events.

## Committees

**Technical Program:** The technical program committee develops submission criteria and deadlines for talks, tutorials, posters, and other conference presentations; recruits reviewers and assigns them submissions; chooses which submissions to accept and communicates with authors; and helps create the program.

**Communications:** The communications committee works with the US-RSE Community Manager to advertise the conference and ensure that attendees receive the information they need for a successful conference.  They also put together written materials and signs for the conference.  If you're good with written communication or graphic design, this committee could use your help.

**Logistics:** The logistics committee coordinates with the venue and local vendors to ensure the details are taken care of and deadlines are met.  The coordinate arrangement of rooms, AV equipment, food orders, arrange for deliveries, and more.  While some logistics committee responsibilities can be handled remotely, being close to the Philadelphia area is a huge asset.

**Sponsorship:** The sponsorship committee develops the sponsorship prospectus, contacts potential sponsors, coordinates sponsor benefits, and ensures sponsors have a good experience during the conference.  

**Student Program:** The student program committee develops special events for undergraduate and graduate student attendees of the conference, advertises the conference to students, and runs student programming during the conference.  

**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion:** Unlike with the other areas, DEI is not a standalone committee or activity.  We are looking for a chair and vice chair who will help advise across the different areas and committees.  In addition, the DEI chair and vice chair will coordinate Code of Conduct reporting during the conference.  

## Roles

**Committee Chairs:** Committee chairs should have experience related to the area they are leading.  They are responsible for recruiting additional committee members if needed, scheduling committee meetings, ensuring US-RSE's [DEI mission](https://us-rse.org/about/dei-mission/) is upheld by the conference, and ensuring the tasks related to their area are completed.

**Committee Vice Chairs:** Committee vice chair positions are a good opportunity for those looking to gain experience with conference planning.  Vice chairs should work closely with the chairs, be able to step in to lead their committee or participate in general conference committee meetings when the chair is not available, and hopefully serve in a committee chair role in the future.  

**Committee Members:** If you're available to help with specific planning tasks, such as writing criteria for submissions, planning a student program event, keeping the website up to date, or creating signs for the conference, please consider joining one of the committees as a member. 



## Expectations for Volunteers

* **Time Commitment**: Participating in the conference planning committee is a year-long commitment.  Meetings will begin in December 2024 and continue through the conference in October 2025.
* **US-RSE Membership:** Volunteers should be members of US-RSE.  It's free to [join](https://us-rse.org/join).
* **Conference Attendance:** Committee chairs and vice chairs are expected to register for and attend the conference in Philadelphia in October 2025.  All committee members are highly encouraged to attend as well.  Volunteers are welcome to apply for any available travel support for the conference, but financial support for attendance is not guaranteed.
* **Meetings:** 
  * General Conference Committee Meetings will be held on Friday afternoons at 3pm Eastern time.  Committee chairs are expected to attend the general meetings.  Committee vice chairs are strongly encouraged to attend, and other committee members are welcome.  General conference committee meetings will initially be held monthly, then biweekly, then weekly in the last few months before the conference.
  * Topical committee meetings will be scheduled as needed by the committee chairs.
