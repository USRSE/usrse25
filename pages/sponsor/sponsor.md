## Introduction

Dear Prospective US-RSE’25 Conference Sponsor,

We are delighted to invite you to join us for the third annual United States Research Software Engineer (US-RSE) Conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 6-8, 2025! 

The US-RSE Association is the leading professional community of research software engineering practitioners in the United States. The organization and its members are dedicated to creating research software that is fit for purpose, sustainable over the long-term and reliably developed and supported. Our members come from diverse backgrounds, but we share a common goal: to support and promote the role of research software and research software engineers in driving innovation and solving complex problems.

As a sponsor of the US-RSE Conference, you will have the opportunity to connect with a professional community and interact with talented expertise and leadership in the field of research software engineering. You will also support the advancement of critical research and development efforts across various disciplines and domains. In our 2024 conference, we hosted over 275 attendees, and we were proud to partner with a diverse array of 14 sponsors, ranging from corporations and academic institutions to national laboratories and small businesses. To view our 2024 sponsors, please visit this [page](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/).

In 2025 we are aiming bigger with a maximum capacity of 300 attendees across three full days. In line with our theme of "Code, Practices, and People", topics of interest for this year’s conference include research software applications and packages, software engineering practices such as code review and reproducibility, leadership and management of research software engineering groups, and career support and professional development for the diverse community of research software engineers.

We hope you will consider joining us for this exciting event and supporting the US-RSE community. Sponsorship provides an opportunity to help this expanding field mature and provides a great way to connect your organization with in-demand professional talent. The attached prospectus describes sponsorship options and benefits. US-RSE now also offers organizational memberships, and premier members receive a 20% discount on conference sponsorship. More information on organizational memberships can be found on our [website](https://us-rse.org/org-membership/).

Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,\
Christina Maimone & Curt Hillegas\
Conference General Chairs\
US-RSE Association

* For Gold, Platinum, and Silver sponsors with an additional fee, your organization will have the option to host a Lunch and Learn session about a topic of your choosing that will be open to all attendees during lunch one day of the conference. Note that there is limited availability for these sessions, and they will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis.  The available room has capacity for approximately 40 attendees.
* For Platinum sponsors with an additional fee, your organization will have the option to host a sponsored session or workshop during the conference for an additional fee, which will give you a platform to showcase your products, services, career opportunities, and thought leadership in front of a highly engaged and targeted audience. In order to ensure space in the program for this session, the deadline to request this benefit is July 1, 2025.
